Rock, paper, scissor, I play against the mirror <br> 
There hasn't been a winner for nine days straight <br> 
I went to see the doctor, she cut open my head <br> 
Took a look inside and this is what she said <br> 
Boy, you're not alone, although you feel alone <br> 
You're just like everyone <br> 
You're holding on  <br> 
Gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
I'm the gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now, I'm dancing <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now, I'm dancing <br> 
She said, You don't need money to build a swimming pool <br> 
I'm running all my taps, gonna flood the bathroom <br> 
All my friends are queuing up, they wanna dive in <br> 
They wanna figure out if they will sink or swim <br> 
You're not alone, although you feel alone <br> 
You're just like everyone <br> 
You're holding on <br> 
I'm the gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
I'm the gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now, I'm dancing <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now, I'm dancing <br> 
I, I want a vacant mind <br> 
Wanna dance 'til my shoes fall apart <br> 
And moon falls out of the sky <br> 
It's just a little dream of mine <br> 
I'm the gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
I'm the gold rush kid, robbing the bank <br> 
Making a run for it and learning to dance <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now I'm dancing <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now I'm dancing <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now I'm dancing <br> 
Watching me now, now, now <br> 
I see you watching me now I'm dancing <br>
